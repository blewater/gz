                <p>
                    Under the General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to access,
                    rectify, port and delete some of your data. You also have the right to
                    object to and restrict certain processing of your data. This is a
                    case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the
                    data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational
                    retention needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may exercise any of the rights described in this section before your
                    Data Controller and Payments Data Controller by sending an email to
                    <a class="text-gz" href="mailto:dpo@everymatrix.com">dpo@everymatrix.com</a>. Please note that we may ask you to verify your
                    identity before taking further action on your request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please be aware that whilst we will try to accommodate any request you make
                    in respect of your rights they are not absolute rights. This means that we
                    may have to refuse your request or may only be able to comply with it in
                    part.

                    You may access and update some of your information through your Account

                    You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal
                    information concerning you (and which you cannot update yourself within
                    your Account).

                    You have the right to access your personal data held by us and a right to
                    receive certain personal data in a structured, commonly used, and

                    5.4. DATA RETENTION AND ERASURE
                </h5>
                <p>
                    We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to perform the
                    contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations.
                    Accordingly, the Data Controller and/or the Payments Data Controller shall
                    maintain your personal data for up to 7 years following the closure of your
                    Account (if applicable) or the last contact with us emanating from you.
                    Where it is no longer necessary to process your personal data, it will be
                    deleted. Please note, however, that we may be subject to legal and
                    regulatory requirements to keep personal data for a longer period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have the right to have certain personal data erased where it is no
                    longer necessary for us to process it, where you have withdrawn your
                    consent pursuant to paragraph 5.5, where you have objected pursuant to
                    paragraph 5.6, where your personal data has been unlawfully processed, or
                    where erasing your personal data is required in accordance with a legal
                    obligation;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:
                </p>
                <p>
                    a. We can retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary
                    to comply with our legal obligations. For example, we may keep some of your
                    information for tax, anti-money laundering reporting and auditing
                    obligations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    b. We can retain some of your personal information as necessary for our
                    legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and
                    enhancing safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    c. Information that we receive about you (including financial transaction
                    data) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the
                    subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation or
                    investigations of possible breaches of our Terms or Policies, or otherwise
                    to prevent harm.

                    5.5. WITHDRAWING CONSENT AND RESTRICTION OF PROCESSING
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Where we have specifically requested your consent to process your personal
                    data and have no other lawful conditions to rely on, you have the right to
                    withdraw this consent at any time by changing your Account settings or by
                    sending a communication to <a class="text-gz" href="mailto:dpo@everymatrix.com">dpo@everymatrix.com</a> specifying which consent you
                    are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not
                    affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent
                    before its withdrawal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in
                    which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest
                    the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful
                    and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer
                    need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you
                    require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
                    claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to next
                    section and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the
                    Data Controller override your own.

                    5.6. OBJECTION TO PROCESSING
                </h5>
                <p>
                    You have the right to object to processing where lawful basis is that it is
                    in our legitimate interests, but please note that we may still process your
                    personal data where there are other relevant lawful bases or where we have
                    compelling grounds to continue processing your personal data in our
                    interests which are not overridden by your rights, interests or freedoms;
                </p>
                <p>
                    You also have the right to object to direct marketing, which can be done by
                    opting-out of direct marketing either via your Account settings or by
                    opting out via the communication itself. You also have a right to object to
                    any profiling to the extent that it relates to direct marketing only.

                    Ukraine and China. Such sharing is necessary for us given our legitimate
                    interest availing ourselves of development services and to fulfil the

                    it is within the EEA and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, by relying
                    on the use of standard contractual clauses or binding corporate rules or
