                    <p>Self-exclusion - If you feel that you may have lost control of your gambling, we provide a self-exclusion facility which can be activated by contacting <a class="text-gz" href="mailto:help@greenzorro.com">help@greenzorro.com</a>. Self-exclusion means that your account will remain closed during the entire exclusion period, which can be set for a minimum of 6 months. This is the major difference to a standard account closure request. Should you wish to activate permanent self-exclusion you may do so by contacting the above email address. Any funds remaining in your account/s, shall be immediately returned to You, with an applied deduction equivalent to the transaction processing fees.</p>
                    <p>Should You self-exclude and afterwards, during the applicable self-exclusion period, succeed in opening an account, depositing and playing, all of your bets shall be voided by us and all of your deposits will be returned to You, with an applied deduction equivalent of the transaction processing fees. This will occur immediately upon detection and You agree to waive any and all claims relating to the respective amounts.</p>
                    <p>We may, in certain events of Self-exclusion, contact you in order to transfer your outstanding funds from your player account. We may ask you to provide account details or payment method details (such as bank account details or other applicable methods) in order to perform the refund; Kindly make sure that all account details, such as email address, full name, etc. are accurate at all times. Kindly see clause 9.7 related to retaining funds.</p>
                    <p>Reasonable endeavours will be used to enforce your self-exclusion. However, you acknowledge that the primary responsibility for controlling your behaviour lies with you, thus you accept that we will not be liable if you continue gambling and/or seek to use the Website and we fail to recognise or determine that. We also recommend that consideration is given to the installation of software that will allow you to block access to internet gambling websites. See Filtering Systems at the bottom of this page.</p>

To close your Member Account, simply send an email to help@greenzorro.com stating your account details and your intention to close the Member Account.</p>
        <p>The method of repayment will be at our absolute discretion.</p>
        <p>The Operators reserve the right to close Your Member Account and to refund to You the account balance, subject to applicable deductions, at the Operators’ absolute discretion and without any obligation to state a reason or give prior notice.</p>
        <p>The Operators reserve the right to withhold and remove any bonuses awarded to you if such bonuses have not been used within 3 months from the date when they were awarded.</p>

            Accounts with no login or game player are managed by the Operators in a specific process:
            <ol type="A">
                <li>An inactive account is an account that has not been accessed for 12 months, that has a real money balance.</li>
                <li>A dormant account is an account that has not been accessed for 30 months, that has a real money balance.</li>
            </ol>
            The Operators will contact you should your account become inactive. If, after 12 months since last login, we are unable to contact you, the Operators will charge a EUR 5.00 per month administrative fee on your account and shall use reasonable efforts to contact you. The administrative fee shall be charged for as long as there is a balance in your account. Once your account becomes dormant, if we have been unable to contact You, the Operators will, in accordance with the applicable law, close your account and transfer your remaining account balance to the MGA. If, after the Operators have begun charging your account with the Administrative Fee, and before your account becomes dormant, you start playing on your account, the Operators will refund to your account the administrative fees charged. If there are no transactions recorded on the Account we reserve the right to remit the balance on the Account to the MGA. Once the money is sent to the MGA, we reserve the right to close the Account, and you should contact the MGA.

                        <li>This license applies only to the object code of the Software (i.e., the compiled, assembled, or machine executable version of the Software) and does not grant you any rights whatsoever with respect to the source code of the Software.</li>
                        <li>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, persons located in the Prohibited Jurisdictions are not permitted to use the Software in any way or manner in connection with any real-money play. To remove any doubt, this restriction also applies to residents and citizens of other nations while located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction. This license does not apply to, and does not allow You the use of the Software in or from any Prohibited Jurisdictions, and the fact that the Website is accessible in a Prohibited Jurisdiction, or that the Software allows the use of the official language of a Prohibited Jurisdiction, shall not be construed as a license to use the Software in such Prohibited Jurisdiction. Any attempt to circumvent this restriction, for example, by using a VPN, proxy or similar service that masks or manipulates the identification of Your real location, or by otherwise providing false or misleading information regarding your location, citizenship, or place of residence, or by making bets or wagers using the Software through a third party or on behalf of a third party located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction, is a breach of this agreement and may constitute a criminal offense under applicable laws. If it becomes apparent, or We have reasonable grounds to suspect, that You are located in any of the Prohibited Jurisdictions, this may result in closing Your Player Account, without an obligation to provide You with advance notice, freezing the funds therein and providing the applicable details to Vendor and/or relevant authorities, all in accordance with applicable laws and agreements, and You shall be liable to Us for any damage or loss resulting therefrom. IT IS YOUR DUTY TO CONSULT AND CHECK REGULARLY OUR WEBSITE REGARDING THE LIST OF THE PROHIBITED JURISDICTIONS.</li>
