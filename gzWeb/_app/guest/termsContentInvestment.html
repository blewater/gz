                <li>The investments accumulate on a monthly basis, based on the net losses of each player at the end of every month.</li>
                <li>The monthly clearance takes place at the end of each month, according to which the players’ net losses for the month in question are calculated (24 to 48 hours after the end of the calendar month). Therefore, the Investment Bonus for a given month cannot be claimed throughout the month but only after the monthly clearance has been processed, that is, at the beginning of the coming month.</li>
                <li>There is a minimum investment hold period of 90 days, per monthly investment vintage, during which the invested funds will be locked in the selected portfolio.</li>
                <li>If you wish to liquidate one of your monthly vintages prior to the minimum 90-day hold period, a 25% early redemption fee will apply. An early redemption may occur as early as 24 to 48 hours after the end of the calendar month for that months investment bonus.</li> 
                <li>Shall players decide to request their Investment bonus, they may do so using the "Withdraw" button found on the "Summary" page of their Investment account. Note that the bonus awarding process might take up to 48 hours from the time that the request is executed.</li>
                <li>
                    Post 90 days, you can continue on your selected portfolio, change investment strategy, or liquidate and transfer earnings to games. Liquidation carries an industry-standard fee of 4% on the total investment amount, plus a 25% fee on the investment gains above a 10% return.
                    <p style="margin-left: 5%">
                        Example 1:<br />
                        A player has an active investment of 1,000 EUR in his account. After 3 months, the total investment amount is 1,060 EUR, with a 6% yield, and he chooses to liquidate it.<br />
                        Upon liquidation a 4% fee will be deducted from the total amount (1,060 EUR - 4%) and the player will eventually receive 1,018 EUR.<br />
                        Example 2:<br />
                        A player has an active investment of 1,000 EUR in his account. After 6 months, the total investment amount is 1,180 EUR, with an 18% yield, and he chooses to liquidate it.<br />
                        Upon liquidation a 4% fee will be deducted from the total investment amount (1,180 EUR * 4% = 47.2 EUR) and an additional 25% fee will be deducted from the investment gains above 10% return (80 EUR * 25% = 20 EUR) and the player will eventually receive 1,113 EUR.
                    </p>
