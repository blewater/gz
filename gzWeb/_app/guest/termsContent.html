                        <td>Instant</td>
                    </tr>

                <li>A dormant account is an account that has not been accessed for 30 months, that has a real money balance.</li>
            </ol>
            The Operators will contact you should your account become inactive. If, after 12 months since last login, we are unable to contact you, the Operators will charge a EUR 5.00 per month administrative fee on your account and shall use reasonable efforts to contact you. The administrative fee shall be charged for as long as there is a balance in your account. Once your account becomes dormant, if we have been unable to contact You, the Operators will, in accordance with the applicable law, close your account and transfer your remaining account balance to the MGA. If, after the Operators have begun charging your account with the Administrative Fee, and before your account becomes dormant, you start playing on your account, the Operators will refund to your account the administrative fees charged. If there are no transactions recorded on the Account we reserve the right to remit the balance on the Account to the MGA. Once the money is sent to the MGA, we reserve the right to close the Account, and you should contact the MGA.
