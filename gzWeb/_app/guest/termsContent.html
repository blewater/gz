            <ol>
                <li>We are committed to endorsing responsible gaming as a policy of customer care and social responsibility. We believe it is our responsibility to you, our customers, to ensure that you enjoy your wagering experience on our site, while remaining fully aware of the social and financial harms associated with problem gambling.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Financial Limits - A player may set financial limits mainly related to deposits, wagers and losses by contacting our Support team or by going to ‘My Account’ section, if available. Once these limits are set the player will not be able to exceed these limits.</p>
                    <p>Limits can be amended at any time. A decrease in the deposit limit will take effect immediately, but an increase can only occur after a 7 day cooling-off period, in order to avoid rash decisions. If you require any further information or assistance regarding responsible gaming, please contact Support.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Self-exclusion - If you feel that you may have lost control of your gambling, we provide a self-exclusion facility which can be activated by contacting <a class="text-gz" href="mailto:help@greenzorro.com">help@greenzorro.com</a>. Self-exclusion means that your account will remain closed during the entire exclusion period, which can be set for a minimum of 6 months. This is the major difference to a standard account closure request. Should you wish to activate permanent self-exclusion you may do so by contacting the above email address.</p>
                    <p>Reasonable endeavours will be used to enforce your self-exclusion. However, you acknowledge that the primary responsibility for controlling your behaviour lies with you, thus you accept that we will not be liable if you continue gambling and/or seek to use the Website and we fail to recognise or determine that. We also recommend that consideration is given to the installation of software that will allow you to block access to internet gambling websites. See Filtering Systems at the bottom of this page.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Underage Gambling - It is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to open an account or to gamble on our website. We carry out age verification checks on all customers who use payment mechanisms which are available to under 18s and additionally perform random age verification checks on customers using other forms of funding mechanisms.  Please note that anyone under the age of 18 found to be using the site will have any winnings forfeited and may also be reported to the authorities.</li>
                <li>Filtering Systems - Filtering solutions allow parents to regulate access to the internet, based on chosen criteria. Parents can use filters to prevent their children from accessing, amongst other things, gambling websites. If you share your computer with friends or family who are under the legal age to register or bet on our site, or have requested self-exclusion from gambling sites, please consider parental filtering solutions</li>
                <li>Setting of Session Time Limits – A player may set maximum Session Time Limits by contacting our support team. Once these limits are set the player will not be allowed to continue playing above the pre set time limit in any one session.</li>
                <li>Any notice increasing or revoking a limit or decreasing exclusion will be accompanied by a seven (7) day cool down period in which the player will not be able to revert the conditions previously placed on his account.</li>
                <li>

Once your account becomes dormant, if we have been unable to contact You, the Operators will, in accordance with the applicable law, close your account and transfer your remaining account balance to the MGA. If, after the Operators have begun charging your account with the Administrative Fee, and before your account becomes dormant, you start playing on your account, the Operators will refund to your account the administrative fees charged. If there are no transactions recorded on the Account we reserve the right to remit the balance on the Account to the MGA.
