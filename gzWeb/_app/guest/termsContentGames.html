            <h5>CHANGES TO THE TERMS OF USE</h5>
            <ol>

            <h5>OPENING YOUR ACCOUNT</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>In order to place a bet via the Website, you will need to open an account on the website ("<b>Your Account</b>").</li>
                <li>We make no warranties or representations as to whether your accessing and/or use of the Website or Services is compliant with applicable laws in the jurisdiction in which you are located and you warrant that online gambling is not illegal
                    in your jurisdiction.</li>
                <li>For various legal or commercial reasons, we do not permit accounts to be opened by, or used from, customers based or domiciled in certain jurisdictions. You may not use the Website and/or the Services if you are located in a prohibited
                    jurisdiction. The fact that the Website is accessible in a prohibited jurisdiction, or that the Website is provided in the official language of a prohibited jurisdiction, shall not be construed as condoning the use of the Website in
                    such prohibited jurisdiction. Any attempt to evade this restriction (e.g. by using a VPN, proxy or similar service that masks or manipulates the identification of your real location, or by otherwise providing false or misleading information
                    regarding your location, citizenship, or place of residence, or by making bets or wagers using the Website through a third party or on behalf of a third party located in a prohibited jurisdiction) is a breach of these Terms and may
                    constitute a criminal offence under applicable laws. If it becomes apparent, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect, that you are located in any of the prohibited jurisdictions, this may result in us closing your Account, without
                    an obligation to provide you with advance notice, freezing the funds therein and providing the applicable details to any relevant authorities and you shall compensate us for any damage or loss resulting therefrom.</li>
                <li>When attempting to open an account or using the website from any other jurisdiction it is the responsibility of the player to verify whether gambling is legal in that particular jurisdiction. You are responsible for ensuring that you comply
                    with any laws applicable to gambling online in the country in which you are located and/or are a resident of. You must not access the Website and/or open an Account from within a jurisdiction that prohibits online gambling; nor must
                    you do so if you are a citizen of a country that prohibits its citizens from participating in online gambling, irrespective of their location.</li>
                <li>A player must register personally by following the on-screen instructions.</li>
                <li>When you open your Account you will be asked to provide us with personal information, including your name, date of birth, and appropriate contact details, including an address, telephone number and e-mail address ("<b>Your Contact Details</b>").</li>

                    may be closed by us immediately and:
                    <ol>
                        <li>If the total amount deposited to the Duplicate Account is played and lost, you agree to renounce your claim on the amounts deposited in the respective Duplicate Account;</li>
                        <li>if the total amount deposited on the Duplicate Account has not been used to place any bets, we will apply a fee of 50% of the deposited amount and return the remaining 50% to you.</li>
                        <li>If the amounts deposited to the Duplicate Account have been used to place bets which resulted in winnings, winnings will be made void and we will apply a fee of 50% of the total deposited amount on the Duplicate Account and return
                            the remaining deposit to you. In the situation where after voiding the winnings, the remaining amount on the Duplicate Account is lower than 50% of the total amount that has been deposited by you, we will charge you a fee amounting
                            to the remaining balance in your Duplicate Account.</li>
                        <li>any returns, winnings or bonuses which you have gained or accrued during such time as the Duplicate Account was active will be forfeited by you and may be reclaimed by us, and you will return to us on demand any such funds which

                    a new account, for such action nor for any direct or indirect consequential damages. The company shall have the right to close, at any time, a new account opened in breach of the requirement stated herein.</li>

                    <p>
                        If a player account remains inactive (i.e.: when no login is performed at the operator’s website) for a period of more than 12 months, the operator is entitled to charge a monthly account maintenance fee of €5, starting on the 13th month
                        of inactivity. Following 12 months of uninterrupted inactivity, the operator will send a reminder mail to the user via the e-mail address saved in his/her account details. Upon receipt of this reminder mail, the user will have 30 days
                        to log into his/her player account. If no login is registered within this 30-day period, €5 of real money credit or bonus money credit will be deducted from the balance. If the balance is less than €5 then the whole amount will be
                        deducted. If the account remains inactive after 13 consecutive months, the user will be sent a reminder mail every month and a monthly charge of €5 will be incurred and deducted from the player account balance accordingly.

                        If the player account remains inactive for more than 12 months and the account balance is €0, no further charge will be incurred. The inactivity fee will be incurred on a monthly basis until the next login is performed at the website,
                        in this case, the operator is entitled to block the player account.

                    <p>
                        Should a player account remain inactive for thirty months, meaning that no transaction has been recorded on that specific account for the above mentioned time, we will remit the remaining balance in that account to the respective player.
                        If the player cannot be contacted satisfactorily, the remaining balance shall be remitted to the relevant gambling authority.

                            activate permanent self-exclusion you may do so by contacting the above email address. Any funds remaining in your account/s, shall be immediately returned to You, with an applied deduction equivalent to the transaction processing
                            fees.
                        </p>
                        <p>Should You self-exclude and afterwards, during the applicable self-exclusion period, succeed in opening an account, depositing and playing, all of your bets shall be voided by us and all of your deposits will be returned to You,
                            with an applied deduction equivalent of the transaction processing fees. This will occur immediately upon detection and You agree to waive any and all claims relating to the respective amounts.</p>
                        <p>We may, in certain events of Self-exclusion, contact you in order to transfer your outstanding funds from your player account. We may ask you to provide account details or payment method details (such as bank account details or
                            other applicable methods) in order to perform the refund; Kindly make sure that all account details, such as email address, full name, etc. are accurate at all times. Kindly see clause 9.7 related to retaining funds.</p>
                        <p>Reasonable endeavours will be used to enforce your self-exclusion. However, you acknowledge that the primary responsibility for controlling your behaviour lies with you, thus you accept that we will not be liable if you continue
