                        greenzorro was conceived with the idea that players can get back much
                        more value for their spent. Players enjoy the upside but are protected
                        from the downside through the investment of their own losses. greenzorro
                        will not generate any profit from gambling but only from management fees
                        on players investments.

                        from the downside by having 50% of their net losses being returned to them 
                        as a bonus. greenzorro invests these funds to increase bonuses returned to 
                        players.
